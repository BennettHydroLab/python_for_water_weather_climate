# Python for research in Water, Weather, and Climate
‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó Warning: This course is under active development. Many of the modules are currently lacking exposition and exercises. Check back for updates!

This course is intended to introduce the basics of the modern data science stack for water, weather, and climate research. Folks from other Earth/environmental fields should also find useful lessons here. The content in this course is accessible via a [JupyterBook](https://arbennett.github.io/python_for_water_weather_climate/README.html) which can be browsed online. It is also availabe to be run in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=565319270). This course is based off of content originally developed for the University of Arizona class HWRS 401/501 "Tools for Data Handling and Analysis in Water, Weather, & Climate" also known as "HAS Tools".
