Most high-level programming languages have tricks to avoid writing verbose code, and python is no difference. The way that we can do that here is to use what's called a \"list comprehension\". Without getting too in the weeds, you can just imagine putting the `for` loop inside of the brackets (`[` and `]`) that define a list. Let's just see the translation to keep things concrete:"

As a general rule of thumb, list comprehensions are mainly useful for making your code more readable, but don't offer any large performance benefits or new functionality that can't be achieved with a regular `for` loop. We will be using list comprehensions in the example code to keep things concise."
