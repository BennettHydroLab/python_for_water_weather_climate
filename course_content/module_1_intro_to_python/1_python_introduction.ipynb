    "As you saw this is a jupyter notebook. It has \"cells\" which are small chunks of code or text that can be edited or run individually. The text you see here is written in markdown, a simplified way of formatting documents. If you want to see how this is written under the hood, you can double click anywhere in this \"cell\" (the space highlighted by the colored bar on the left, if you click on the text here). Doing so will open up the \"edit mode\" for the cell where you can see the \"markdown code\" that produced the formatted text. For instance you can see that headers are defined with the `#` symbol, and adding additional `#` symbols makes subheaders. Anyhow, we'll get more into markdown later in the course where we dive a bit more deeply into the Jupyter ecosystem. For now, you can get out of edit mode by either clicking the \"play button\" on the toolbar just at the top of this `python_introduction.ipynb` tab, or by pressing `<shift>+<enter>` on your keyboard.\n",

    "Jupyter notebooks + markdown are a great way to document your code and workflows. Being able to mix formatted text and executable code means it is easier to share and explain what and why you are doing things. It also provides a nice way to organize an entire workflow. One part of what makes Jupyter notebooks so nice is that you can interact with the outputs of your code easily, making it very clear what has run and what happened. Let's dive into python!\n",

We already saw that on numeric data `+` is just addition. But adding together text doesn't make sense in the same way as adding numbers. The way that adding strings work is referred to as \"concatenation\", which basically just means stick them together end to end. You can see how this works below."

There are some subtleties to the difference between these two formats, but we won't get into them for a while. The main difference is that for certain data types there are functions which are very special to that data type, so they are attached to the variable directly. For example, the `upper()` function would not make sense for any other data type other than strings, so python makes it attached to string data types directly. This is in contrast to something like the `type` function which can take *any* data type as the input, so it is left generic.\n",

    "A point of important vocabulary however, is that you may find that when functions are attached to variable instances (i.e. `variable.function()`), that the function may be referred to as a \"method\".

    "As always, there are more things that you can do with dictionaries than we can cover here, but it's worth highlighting a couple of pieces of functionality. First off, if you want to look at all of the individual keys or values in your dictionary you can use the the `keys` and `values` methods. Additionally, these can be converted to lists or tuples, which is sometimes easier to work with. If you want to try to get something out of a dictionary, but aren't sure it will be in there you can try use the `.get` method to specify both a `key` and a `default` so that if the key doesn't exist you don't get a `KeyError` but rather whatever default value you specify. This can be useful when you're ingesting data from others and don't necessarily know what you'll get."

    "Now that you know something about different data types we can talk about how to specify operations on those data types in a concise and controlled manner. Generally, we talk about controlling the flow of data through a program via either loops or conditionals. There are multiple ways that these concepts can be inplemented in a programming langauge, but for python you mainly can get by with `for` loops, `while` loops, and `if` statements. Let's start with talking about `if` statements because they're generally the easiest to understand and provide a good jumping off point for some of the finer points of python syntax.\n",

For instance if you just wanted to see if a number was greater than 0 and if so, print it out you would do the following:"
