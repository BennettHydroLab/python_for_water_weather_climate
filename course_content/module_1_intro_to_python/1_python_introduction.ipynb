    "As you see this is a jupyter notebook. It has \"cells\" which are small chunks of code or text that can be edited or run individually. The text you see here is written in markdown, a simplified way of formatting documents. If you want to see how this is written under the hood, you can double click anywhere in this \"cell\" (the space highlighted by the colored bar on the left, if you click on the text here). Doing so will open up the \"edit mode\" for the cell where you can see the \"markdown code\" that produced the formatted text. For instance you can see that headers are defined with the `#` symbol, and adding additional `#` symbols makes subheaders. Anyhow, we'll get more into markdown later in the course where we dive a bit more deeply into the Jupyter ecosystem. For now, you can get out of edit mode by either clicking the \"play button\" on the toolbar just at the top of this `python_introduction.ipynb` tab, or by pressing `<shift>+<enter>` on your keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks + markdown are a great way to document your code and workflows. Being able to mix formatted text and executable code means it is easier to share and explain what and why you are doing things. It also provides a nice way to organize an entire workflow. One part of what makes Jupyter notebooks so nice is that you can interact with the outputs of your code easily, making it very clear what has run and what happened. Let's dive into python!\n",

    "## Simple arithmetic\n",
    "Below there are more \"cells\" that consist of python code, rather than markdown. You an run these by hitting `<shift>+<enter>` on your keyboard. Let's start very basic by doing some simple arithmetic with python statements. Statements are just single line of code. As you can see, basic arithmetic works!"

This reuse helps save time, and makes reusing code easier. We do this by using the fact that the `+` operator acts differently on strings than it does on numeric data. We already saw that on numeric data `+` is just addition. But adding together text doesn't make sense in the same way as adding numbers. The way that adding strings work is referred to as \"concatenation\", which basically just means stick them together end to end. You can see how this works below."

    "Booleans, or just `bool`s are binary variables. They can take 2 values: `True` or `False` (note capitalization). You can do basic elementary logic with them. They work well with other types of data and make it easy to check if various conditions are met. For example, inequalities with numeric data will convert to a boolean with the appropriate values, and similarly, you can see if a certain pattern is contained in a string:"

There are some subtleties to the difference between these two formats, but we won't get into them for a while. The main difference is that for certain data types there are functions which are very special to that data type, so they are attached to the variable directly. For example, the `upper()` function would not make sense for any other data type other than strings, so python makes it attached to string data types directly. This is in contrast to something like the `type` function which can take *any* data type as the input, so it is left generic.\n",

    "A point of important vocabulary however, is that you may find that when functions are attached to variable instances (i.e. `variable.function()`), that the function may be referred to as a \"method\".

    "As always, there are more things that you can do with dictionaries than we can cover here, but it's worth highlighting a couple of pieces of functionality. First off, if you want to look at all of the individual keys or values in your dictionary you can use the the `keys` and `values` methods. Additionally, these can be converted to lists or tuples, which is sometimes easier to work with. If you want to try to get something out of a dictionary, but aren't sure it will be in there you can try use the `.get` method to specify both a `key` and a `default` so that if the key doesn't exist you don't get a `KeyError` but rather whatever default value you specify. This can be useful when you're ingesting data from others and don't necessarily know what you'll get.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Dictionaries are a very useful data structure in python, but they can be a bit tricky to iterate over. The main reason for this is that dictionaries are unordered, so there is no guarantee that the order of the keys will be the same as the order that you put them into the dictionary. If you require a specific order, you can use the `OrderedDict` class from the `collections` module, but this is a bit beyond the scope of this course.\n",

    "Now that you know something about different data types we can talk about how to specify operations on those data types in a concise and controlled manner. Generally, we talk about controlling the flow of data through a program via either loops or conditionals. There are multiple ways that these concepts can be inplemented in a programming langauge, but for python you mainly can get by with `for` loops, `while` loops, and `if` statements. Let's start with talking about `if` statements because they're generally the easiest to understand and provide a good jumping off point for some of the finer points of python syntax.\n",

    "Yet another common pain point for python beginners is getting used to aligning whitespace. In python the whitespace used to indent different code blocks is important! Inside of control flow statements (like the `if` statement that we'll see soon) the code needs to be indented. Additionally, every line of code within that block needs to be indented in exactly the same way as all of the others. It is most common to use 4 spaces to indent these code blocks, although using 2 or even 8 spaces is occasionally used. We'll stick with 4 spaces for now. If you don't have everything lined up you'll probably see an error like:\n",

For instance if you just wanted to see if a number was greater than 0 and if so, print it out you would do the following."

This is something we've already seen in the section about string data types. Then, going up in the traceback we see that it shows our function definition, but with a big arrow pointing to the 3rd line. This is the line that caused our error.

    "One of the reasons python has become very popular in data science is the number of useful packages it has. There are many packages which are included in the base python installation which are pretty handy. Additionally, throughout this course we'll look at some other packages developed by the data science and Earth science communities. If you are running this course on GitHub codespaces To get started, let's look at the `import` keyword and import a package (also called a library) called `math`. The `math` library implements a number of common mathematical functions such as sine, cosine, logarithms, and factorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've imported it we can start using it's \"namespace\" which is just to say, you can do `math.function` for any `function` provided by the `math` library. See below how we can use `math.cos` on $\\pi$, which is also provided via `math.pi`."

    "But, you might ask: How do we know what functions we get from importing a module? Over time you will develop some muscle memory about what packages provide what functions, but you can also run the `dir` function on the module name directly to see what's inside. Additionally, learning to read python module's documentation pages is an essential skill that will help you understand what functions are available, what they do, and what inputs/outputs they have. [Here's the documentation for the math module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html). We can also see the output from running `dir(math)` below. Ignoring the ones that start with `__` (it's a weird python thing) you can see all of our basic math functions."

Any time you have a code block that you find yourself repeating in your analysis it's a good idea to try to wrap it up into a function so that you don't have to write the code from scratch all the time. Later in the course materials we'll get more into ways to package code for reuse, which will rely on your knowledge of functions.\n",
