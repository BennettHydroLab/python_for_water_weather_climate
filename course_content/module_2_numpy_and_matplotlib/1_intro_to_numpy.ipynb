As you already saw in the very first example though, `numpy` does this by smartly applying functions and operations to all elements in an array. At it's most basic level this will happen element-wise, as we saw previously. To demonstrate this again, we can simply multilply our `ones_matrix` by a scalar value and it will automatically do the right thing. Operating on the arrays directly, rather than manually iterating over the values individually is commonly referred to as \"vectorization\" in the `numpy` world."

    "\n",
    " * `np.eye`: Creates the identity matrix.\n",
    " * `np.tri`: Creates a lower-tridiagonal matrix.\n",
    " * `np.arange`: A `numpy` counterpart to the built-in `range` function.\n",
    " * `np.linspace`: Similar to `np.arange`, except you can specify the number of elements, rather than the step between consecutive elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Array transformation functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed in the `air_pressure_at_height` function we replaced the `math.exp` function call with `np.exp` - this is what we'll call an \"array transformation\". These types of functions take a numpy array as an input and then return a new array with the same shape but different values. This includes many of the common mathematical operations you're already familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    " * `np.exp`: Takes the exponential of the input array.\n",
    " * `np.log`: Takes the (natural) logarithm of the input array.\n",
    " * `np.sin`: Calculates the sine function on each element of the input array.\n",
    " * `np.abs`: Takes the absolute value of each element of the input array.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Aggregation functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to functions which take an array as input and then returns either a scalar value, or another array with some reduced size (usually by removing one of the dimensions) as \"aggregation functions\". Often, the default of these types of functions is to aggregate over the full array and return a scalar value, and if you only want to apply the aggregation along a certain dimension/axis you provide that explicitly as an additional argument. We'll demonstrate this in a moment. For now, some commonly used aggregations are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * `np.sum`: Takes the sum of elements of a given array.\n",
    " * `np.max`: Takes the maximum value of elements of a given array.\n",
    " * `np.histogram`: Calculates a histogram from a given array using a \"bin counting\" strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is only a small sample of the available functionality within numpy and doesn't cover many of the specialized \"submodules\" such as `np.linalg` for linear algebra functions (such as matrix decompositions), or `np.fft` for calculating Fourier transforms, and `np.random` for random number generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we haven't seen aggregation functions yet, we will take a moment to highlight how that part works for aggregations over full arrays and specific axes. We will use a contrived array, which is a 3x3 matrix whose entries increase linearly from 1 to 9 as defined below."

From the above example in calculating sums we can see that `numpy` is a \"row-major\" array format. That is, the first index into a `numpy` array is along the rows, and the second is along columns. Of course, as you go into higher dimensions this intuition breaks down, but the key thing to keep in mind is to be careful which axes of your arrays you are operating on and being  diligent in making sure that your algorithms work as expected. Operating on array axes in the wrong order will often produce a result, but that doesn't guarantee it is the correct one.\n",
